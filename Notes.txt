JavaScript primitive data types: 
  String, Number, Boolean, undefined, Null, and Symbol.

Strings:
A collection of one or more characters between two single quotes, double quotes, or backticks.

Numbers
Integers: Integer (negative, zero and positive) numbers Example: ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ...
Float-point numbers: Decimal number Example ... -3.5, -2.25, -1.0, 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.5 ...

Booleans
A boolean value is either True or False. Any comparisons returns a boolean value, which is either true or false.
A boolean data type is either a true or false value.

Undefined
In JavaScript, if we don't assign a value to a variable, the value is undefined. In addition to that, if a function is not returning anything, it returns undefined.

Null
Null in JavaScript means an empty value.

To check the data type of a variable you can use the typeof operator. 
EX: 
  console.log(typeof 'Apple')  //string
  console.log(typeof 5)        //number
  console.log(typeof true)     //boolean  
  console.log(typeof null)     //object type
  console.log(typeof undefined)//undefined


Comments can be Single or Multiline 
//This is a singleline comment 
/*
This comment 
can span 
multiple

Variables are containers of data. Variables are used to store data in a memory location. When a variable is declared, a memory location is reserved. When a variable is assigned to a value (data), the memory space will be filled with that data.
 --var is error prone don't use
If a variable may change use  let
If a variable does not need to change use   const 

A valid JavaScript variable name must follow the following rules:
  should not begin with a number.
  does not allow special characters except dollar sign and underscore.
  follows a camelCase convention.
  should not have space between words.

Syntax of nameing a variable: 
  let nameOfVariable = value
  const nameOfVariable = value
